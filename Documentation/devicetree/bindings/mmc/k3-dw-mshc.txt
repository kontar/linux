* Hisilicon specific extensions to the Synopsis Designware Mobile
  Storage Host Controller

Read synopsis-dw-mshc.txt for more details
The Synopsis designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
differences between the core Synopsis dw mshc controller properties described
by synopsis-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Hisilicon specific
extensions to the Synopsis Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

Required Properties:

* compatible: should be
	- "hisilicon,hi4511-dw-mshc": for controllers with hi4511
	  specific extentions.
* vmmc-supply: should be vmmc used in dwmmc
* fifo-depth: should be provided if register can not provide correct value
* clken-reg: should be clock enable register and offset
* drv-sel-reg: should be driver delay select register and offset
* sam-sel-reg: should be sample delay select register and offset
* div-reg: should be divider register and offset

Example:

  The MSHC controller node can be split into two portions, SoC specific and
  board specific portions as listed below.

	dwmmc_0: dwmmc0@fcd03000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,hi4511-dw-mshc";
		reg = <0xfcd03000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 16 4>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		clocks = <&clk_sd>, <&clk_ddrc_per>;
		clock-names = "ciu", "biu";
		clken-reg = <0x1f8 0>;
		drv-sel-reg = <0x1f8 4>;
		sam-sel-reg = <0x1f8 8>;
		div-reg = <0x1f8 1>;
	};
	dwmmc0@fcd03000 {
		num-slots = <1>;
		vmmc-supply = <&ldo12>;
		fifo-depth = <0x100>;
		supports-highspeed;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&sd_pmx_pins &sd_cfg_func1 &sd_cfg_func2>;
		cd-gpio = <&gpio10 3 0>;
		slot@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			bus-width = <4>;
		};
	};

PCTRL:

Required Properties:
* compatible: should be
	- "hisilicon,pctrl": Peripheral control

Example:

	pctrl: pctrl@fca09000 {
		compatible = "hisilicon,pctrl";
		reg = <0xfca09000 0x1000>;
	};
