Broadcom Kona Family I2C
=========================

This I2C controller is used in the following Broadcom SoCs:

  BCM11130
  BCM11140
  BCM11351
  BCM28145
  BCM28155

Required Properties
-------------------
- compatible: "brcm,bcm11351-i2c", "brcm,kona-i2c"
- reg: Physical base address and length of controller registers
- interrupts: The interrupt number used by the controller
- clock-frequency: The I2C bus frequency in Hz
- #address-cells: Should be <1>
- #size-cells: Should be <0>

Example:

i2c@3e016000 {
	compatible = "brcm,bcm11351-i2c","brcm,kona-i2c";
	reg = <0x3e016000 0x80>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 103 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clock-frequency = <400000>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
};
